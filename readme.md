Mongeasy aims to simplify the process of creating Mongoose schemas using a straightforward syntax for defining the schema structure. It employs a flag-based declaration paradigm known as CSS (Carnage Schema Syntax).

## Example:

```javascript
import {model} from mongeasy;
let Computer = model({
	Computer : [
		"name|String|!|*|(3,16)",
		"price|Number|*",
		"madeIn=India|String|ref:CountryNames",
		"dateOfPurchase|Date"
		]
	})
```

## **Output**

will give you a reference to model "Computer", ie a schema.tree output as follows.

```javascript
tree: {
    name: { type: [Function], required: true, index: true, unique: true },
    price: { type: [Function], required: true },
    madeIn: { type: [Function], default: 'India' },
    dateOfPurchase: { type: [Function] },
    color: { type: [Function], required: true, enum: [Array] },
    _id: { auto: true, type: 'ObjectId' }
}
```

### **Format:** `<Name>` | `<Type>` | *`<Modifiers>`

**Name:**

* the name of field, ðŸ˜€ðŸ¥±ðŸ˜´ - emojis also supported

**Type :**

all supported, as we directly pass to Core Library

* [ Array, Boolean, BigInt, Buffer, Date, Decimal, Decimal128, DocumentArray, Map, Mixed, Number, ObjectId, String, Subdocument, UUID, Oid, Object, Bool, ObjectID ]

**Modifiers:**

The syntax consists of the following elements:
Note: "/" means "either option"

* +U / ! = unique
* +R / * = required
* +I / # = index
* (0, 999) = min,max
* ['adam', 'eve'] = enum

## Here's a breakdown of how its used:

* **`Name`** : This part represents the name of the field you want to define in your schema. It's a required element.
* **`Type`** : This part specifies the type of the field, and it's also a required element. You can use any of the supported types provided by Mongoose.
* **`Modifiers`** : These are optional and allow you to add extra attributes or flags to the field. For example, you can use `!` for unique fields, `*` for required fields, and `#` for indexed fields.

This CSS-based declaration paradigm aims to provide a simplified way of defining Mongoose schemas, making it easier to work with MongoDB data models.
